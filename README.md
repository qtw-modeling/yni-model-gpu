# yni_model
GPU-code (OpenACC) for numerical simulation of myocardium tissue using the Yanagihara-Noma-Irisawa ionic model (1980, rabbit SAN's cell).

Model of the tissue: 
- 2D
- gap junctions' conductivities = const
- 1 type of cardiomyocytes present.

Calculations of both discrete and continious media's (i.e. reaction-diffusion/cable equation) models are feasible.
